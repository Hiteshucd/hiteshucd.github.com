                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                   <p>For the final project, I decided to improve my PIG game.
                      I feel I can explore more with this game and learn how to
                      portray score, players and include lives in the game.

                <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
                   <p> I looked up a free version of PIG online and found an
                       interesting example <a href =  "http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/piggame.html">PIG</a>.
                       The game had really interesting animations, especially how
                       the dice roll was integrated in the game. The creator did 
                       a good job of adding difficulty levels which made the 
                       game more interactive.

                <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
                    <p>During my researxh, I came across another interesting
                        game  <a href =  "https://iftemplar.github.io/works/pig-dice-game/">PIG2</a>. In this game
                        the target score was 100 and when the player got one 
                        the score would reset back to 0. This elemnt increases the difficulty 
                        level and a player stays longer on this game than the game
                        I had coded. The dice appear on the center of the screen and 
                        complelety flushes with the concept of the website.

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                   <p>I feel the game I coded was too simple and plain. 
                       It was lacking attractive animations and I feel
                       the buttons were not the way I wanted to portray.
                       Compare with the original design, the final project
                       will have a more immersive experience. To take 
                       advantage of the two Comparison Projects, I will 
                       learn the animation style and import to my project.

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                   <p> Clean look with a welcoming color scheme and illustrations.
                        Form fields designed with high readibility font and color.
                        User friendly locations of buttons and fill areas to make 
                        the process intuitive.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                   <p> will explore more with overlays and show important 
                       messages using overlays. I will include 3 lives per 
                       player which will allow 2 players to play for a longer
                       period of time and make it a series.

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                   <p>Since it is going to be a 2 player game, I want it to
                       be as competetive as possible. I can inclue 2 difficulty
                       levels with the harder one resetting back to 0 when a 
                       player gets a 1.To make the game more fun, I can add more 
                       sound effects so that it gives feedback to the users when 
                       they interact with the buttons.
