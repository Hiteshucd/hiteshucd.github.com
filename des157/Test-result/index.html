                <h2>Test-Result</h2>
                   <p>For the final project, I decided to improve my PIG game.
                      I feel I can explore more with this game and learn how to
                      portray score. I showed my game to 3 peers today and they
                      really helped me understand what is working and what is not.
                      The overlay was readable and easy to follow- My peers sugeested 
                      that it would have been a nice touch if I made the two players' 
                      scoreboard a different color to help distinguish between 
                      them or made the middle game interface change color 
                      once the player changed. When the plaers wins, the font was
                      a little bit small and I will fix that for the final. Overall,
                      I feel I have to make some minir changes and my game will
                      be ready for the final.
