				Filling forms and spending a lot of unnecessary time answering irrelevant questions is one of my biggest pet peeves. 
				The article, "Best practices for form design" helped me understand how I can make an interactive and time-efficient
				 form for the future. The article informs the readers about 20 strategies about different aspects of a form so that
				  they can use these methods to make forms efficient. One of the most interesting parts for me was when the author 
				  talks about the one-column layout as I always thought multiple columns were better, but now that I think about it, 
				  a single column is way faster than multiple.

					Furthermore, the article makes me wonder about all the small details I can now add to my elements to make the
					 form simple flowing, and to the point. For example, distinguishing required and optional fields to avoid wastage 
					 of time, clearly defining labels to get appropriate input, preparing tabs in advance, and inserting them in the 
					 forms to ensure it follows the correct sequence and several others. Overall, now I am more aware of the different
					  elements I can add to the form and make the respondants' job easier.
