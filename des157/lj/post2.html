Before reading the article, I never really paid attention to overlays and how they appear 
over the main page but this article has challenged me to view these in a new light. The 
article talks how about how one can present the overlays in the best possible way, with 
easy controls for the user to quickly complete the task. The writer, “Kathryn Whitenton”,
strongly suggests applying “ the five W’s – Who, What, When, Where, and Why” approach 
which would always help determine whether the overlaying box is concise and easy to 
follow. I had an apple laptop for years and after reading the example I realized that 
the macox always has a separate page for overlay.  </p> <p>After reading this article, I visited
a couple of sites such as Linkedin and Architectural Digest to see how these websites
use overlays, whether they use lightboxes or adjust them with the main page. I feel
confident after reading this article that in the future given the task of making overlays,
I will be able to appropriately apply the concepts from this article in my presentation.  </p>
