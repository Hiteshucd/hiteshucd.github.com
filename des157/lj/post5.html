                The article was really helpful for the upcomming assignment.
                Screen size plays a pivotal role in game design. For my game,
                I will make sure that I place important tools according
                to everyones reach allowing easier and comfortable game
                play. Since we are using almost the entire computer screen of
                the computer, I have a lot of space for different buttons and
                tools, minimising the use of sliders.

                In the Mad libs assignment, I wasnt successful with
                my pop-ups and I want experiment more with them. I
                will try to be more creative with my pop-ups and
                hopefully this time I will be able to display them
                in the way that I want. Dialog boxes will be
                an integral part in my game showing intructions and
                important messages.
