                As a design student knowing about the format of images is important
                Prior to reading to the the article I knew about JPEG, GIF, PNG, and 
                SVG and how they differ from each other, but I never thought abou the 
                differnt ways the format can affect JavaScript and CSS.	     
  </p>

                 It was interersting to read about how the images differ from each 
                 other when you display them as content vs when you use Image with 
                 CSS. I tried to experiment with this and notice for myself how they
                 use different properties in defferent methods. I personally feel 
                 using image as a decoration with CSS is better because it allows me 
                 to display the image as background images can be set to background-size: 
                 cover; allowing the element to crop the image as needed â€“ an effect not 
                 so easily achieved by including the image in the content of the page, 
                 through an img tag.
